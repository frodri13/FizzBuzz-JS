# FizzBuzz-JS

This challenge consists on coding the FizzBuzz challenge using JavaScript, and Jasmine for testing.

# FizzBuzz Logic

When giving our method a number, if it is divisible by 3, the program should return `fizz`; if it is divisible by 5, `Buzz`; if it is both
divisible by 3 and 5, then it should return `FizzBuzz`; otherwise, it should just return the number back.

# Testing

Since I am using Jasmine, you would need to run this on your terminal, within the main directory:

```
$ open SpecRunner.html
```
